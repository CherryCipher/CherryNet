/**
 * @class StorageManager
 * @brief Provides a simple interface for persistent file storage.
 *
 * The StorageManager is responsible for initializing and accessing the
 * primary storage medium used by Ch3rryB0mb.
 *
 * The rest of the firmware should never communicate directly with the SD
 * library. All file operations should be performed through this manager.
 *
 * Responsibilities
 * ----------------
 * - Initialize the storage device.
 * - Check whether storage is available.
 * - Open files.
 * - Check whether files exist.
 *
 * Future
 * ------
 * The StorageManager is intentionally hardware independent. Although the
 * current implementation uses an SD card, it can later be replaced with
 * LittleFS, SPIFFS or another storage backend without changing the rest of
 * the firmware.
